# Instructions 

To run the project on your device, you only need 4 files: [testing2.ipynb](testing2.ipynb), [shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks.dat](shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks.dat), [GenderModel.p](GenderModel.p) and [FaceShapeModel.p](FaceShapeModel.p)

I suggest to download the GitHub repository for shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks.dat from [here](https://github.com/codeniko/shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks) to avoid any errors.

After downloading all these files, you only need to edit the testing2.ipynb file for putting the correct paths for all the models downloaded.
Also make sure that you have all the required libraries installed.
